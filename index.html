                        <p>I am a musician and an English professor in Austin. My novel Troubadours is my love song to Austin and the
                            Hill Country. It draws on my experiences playing salsa in The Live Music Capital of the World and traveling
                            in Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
                        <p>I began writing this novel after reading a newspaper clipping titled “Anonymous Bicyclist Killed in
                            Collision with City Bus.” Since it was about my friend, Fernando Colon, I was outraged that his dying was
                            treated so impersonally. He was not anonymous to his family and friends, especially Austin musicians. He
                            was a powerful spiritual force who healed through music. I felt compelled to write a story that captures
                            not only his spirit, but also the Austin we knew and loved.</p>
